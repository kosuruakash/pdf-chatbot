# PDF Chatbot

## Overview

PDF Chatbot is a web application that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions about their content. The application will retrieve answers from the document if available. If the answer is not found in the PDF, it prompts the user for permission to use Google Generative AI (GEMAI) as a fallback option to generate a response.

## Features

- **PDF Upload**: Users can upload PDF files.
- **Document-based Q&A**: Users can ask questions based on the PDF content.
- **Generative AI Fallback**: If an answer is not available in the document, users are prompted to allow GEMAI assistance to generate a response.

## Architecture

This application is built with a **React frontend** and an **Express backend**:
- **Frontend**: Manages the user interface, including PDF upload and chat functionality.
- **Backend**: Handles PDF ingestion, file storage, vector embeddings for text retrieval, and interactions with Google Generative AI.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **Google Generative AI API Key** for GEMAI-based assistance

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf-chatbot.git
cd pdf-chatbot
```

### Backend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create Environment File**:
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:
   ```plaintext
   PORT=5000
   GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY=your_google_genai_api_key
   VECTOR_STORE_PATH=faiss_index
   ```

3. **Run the Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The backend should now be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Proxy**:
   In the `frontend/package.json`, add the following line to set up a proxy to the backend:
   ```json
   "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
   ```

4. **Run the Frontend Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Upload a PDF**:
   - In the web interface, use the **Upload PDF** button to select and upload a PDF file.
   - The backend processes and indexes the PDF for text retrieval.

2. **Ask a Question**:
   - Type a question in the chatbox about the PDF content.
   - If an answer is found in the document, it will display in the chat.
   - If no answer is found, you will see a prompt asking if you want to use GEMAI to generate a response.

3. **AI Fallback**:
   - If the answer is not found in the document, you will be asked if you want to use GEMAI for assistance.
   - Based on your response, the application will either provide an AI-generated answer or indicate that no answer is available.

## API Documentation

### `POST /upload`
- **Description**: Upload a PDF file to be processed and indexed.
- **Request Body**: Form data with a `file` field (PDF file).
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "filePath": "/uploads/yourfile.pdf"
  }
  ```

### `GET /ask`
- **Description**: Retrieve an answer to a question based on the uploaded PDF content.
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `question` (string) - The user’s question.
  - `permission` (boolean) - Whether to allow GEMAI assistance if an answer is not found in the document.
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "answer": "Your answer here."
  }
  ```

## Application Flow

1. **Frontend** (React):
   - **UploadForm Component**: Handles PDF uploads.
   - **Chat Component**: Manages the Q&A interface and permission prompt for GEMAI.

2. **Backend** (Express):
   - **/upload** Endpoint: Stores the uploaded PDF and re-indexes it for document-based retrieval.
   - **/ask** Endpoint: Checks for answers in the indexed document. If an answer is not available, it prompts for GEMAI fallback based on user permission.

## Troubleshooting

- **Port Conflicts**: Ensure the backend (`PORT=5000`) and frontend (`PORT=3000`) servers are running on different ports.
- **GEMAI API Errors**: Double-check your `GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` if GEMAI responses aren’t working.
